# DirectoryFingerPrinting
DirectoryFingerPrintubg is a powerful .NET/C# library designed for file and directory checksums and metadata management. It offers a comprehensive set of features, including:

- Retrieving metadata such as checksum, creation date, last modification date, and size for files in a directory and subdirectories (recursive).
- Calculating checksums (hashes) for all files within a directory.
- Comparing and detecting changes between two directories or fingerprint files.
## Key Features
- Obtain file metadata: Access creation dates, modification dates, sizes, and more.
- Calculate checksums: Generate hash values (e.g., SHA-1) for files within a directory.
- Identify changes: Detect additions, removals, and modifications to files.
- Efficient file comparisons: Quickly compare and report differences between directories.
- Selectable hashing algorithms: CRC32, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512
